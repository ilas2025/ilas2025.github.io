&lt;p>Kaohsiung is a big city in southern Taiwan. It is located on the southwest coast
and is one of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s largest cities. Kaohsiung has a population of around 2.7
million people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The city has a rich history with a former name Takow given by the indigenous
people. It was originally a small fishing village many years ago. Over time, it
grew into an important port city. Today, Kaohsiung is known for its busy harbor,
which is one of the largest in the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Plan your trip</title><link>https://ilas2025.tw/taiwan/travel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 23:49:51 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ilas2025.tw/taiwan/travel/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="visa">Visa&lt;/h3>

&lt;h3 id="airport">Airport&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kia.gov.tw/english/">Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH)&lt;/a> is the closest airport to the conference venue. However, it has fewer international flights, often requiring a transfer at another major international airport hub in East Asia, such as HKG (Hong Kong), PVG (Shanghai), or NRT (Tokyo Narita).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
