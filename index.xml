It is also the first bridge that can rotate horizontally to let boats pass through.
If the LOGO is viewed as a graph, then it is the graph with its graph6 string &amp;quot;G?}WNc&amp;quot; . It second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue is 1.6202543669426&amp;hellip;
You may run the Sage code below
g = Graph(&amp;#34;G?</description></item><item><title>Copyright</title><link>https://ilas2025.tw/copyright/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 18:19:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ilas2025.tw/copyright/</guid><description>The website was built by Jephian Lin using Hugo static site generators and Ananke theme.
