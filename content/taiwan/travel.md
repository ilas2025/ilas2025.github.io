### Visa

Many countries are eligible for the [visa exemption
program](https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html), with a
duration of stay of up to 90 days.

In general, you may follow the instructions of the [Bureau of Consular
Affairs](https://www.boca.gov.tw/np-137-2.html) to apply for a visa.


### Airport

With fewer flight options, Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH) is
the closest airport to the conference venue.

Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) is the primary airport of
Taiwan and is an important hub in Asia.  Most people arrive to Taiwan
through this airport.  

See the details below for their differences.


### Transportation from the airport to the conference venue

The conference will take place at [NSYSU](https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/).

### iPass and EasyCard

If you don’t like to bring changes with you, you may consider
purchasing an [iPass card](https://www.i-pass.com.tw/en) or an
[EasyCard](https://www.easycard.com.tw/en/).

- iPass or EasyCard allows you to add value to the card and use it in
  public transportation systems (metro systems, buses, public bikes,
  railroad, etc.) and make purchases in convenience stores and various
  places.
- Each card is 100 NTD (non-refundable and not for making
  purchases). You may get refund for your added value if you decide to
  close the card.  ([iPass
  refund](https://www.i-pass.com.tw/en/Page/Refund); [EasyCard
  refund](https://www.easycard.com.tw/en/service))
- You may get the card in various places.  ([Where to buy
  iPass](https://www.i-pass.com.tw/en/Page/StandardAdult); [Where to
  buy
  EasyCard](https://www.easycard.com.tw/en/easycard?cls=1521769569&id=1521769904))
- Two cards are issued by different companies.  However, if a service
  allows you to use one card to pay, it usually allows you to use the
  other card.  They are almost indistinguishable.


### Maps
