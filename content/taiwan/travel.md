### Visa

Many countries are eligible for the [Visa Exemption Program](https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html), with a duration of stay of up to 90 days.

In general, you may follow the instructions of the [Bureau of Consular Affairs](https://www.boca.gov.tw/np-137-2.html) to apply for a visa.

### Airport

[Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH)](https://www.kia.gov.tw/english/) is the closest airport to the conference venue. However, it has fewer international flights, often requiring a transfer at another major international airport hub in East Asia, such as HKG (Hong Kong), PVG (Shanghai), or NRT (Tokyo Narita).

[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE)](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/?lang=en) is Taiwan’s primary airport and a major hub in Asia. Most travelers enter Taiwan through this airport.

See the details for transportation below for landing at different airports.

### Stored-value Card (iPass and EasyCard)

If you don’t like to bring changes with you, you may consider purchasing an [iPass card](https://www.i-pass.com.tw/en) or an [EasyCard](https://www.easycard.com.tw/en/).

* iPass or EasyCard allows you to add value to the card and use it in public transportation systems (metro systems, buses, public bikes, railroad, etc.) and make purchases in convenience stores and various places.  
* Each card is 100 NTD (non-refundable and not for making purchases). You may get refund for your added value if you decide to close the card. ([iPass refund](https://www.i-pass.com.tw/en/Page/Refund); [EasyCard refund](https://www.easycard.com.tw/en/service))  
* You may get the card in various places. ([Where to buy iPass](https://www.i-pass.com.tw/en/Page/StandardAdult); [Where to buy EasyCard](https://www.easycard.com.tw/en/easycard?cls=1521769569&id=1521769904))  
* Two cards are issued by different companies. However, if a service allows you to use one card to pay, it usually allows you to use the other card. They are almost indistinguishable.
