Taiwan is a country in East Asia that consists of 168 islands.  The
main island of Taiwan, also known as Ilha Formosa, has mountain ranges
covering its eastern two-thirds and plains spreading the western
third, with the Tropic of Cancer crossing it.  The capital, Taipei, is
in the north, while the hosting city of ILAS2025, Kaohsiung, is in the
south.  Your visit in June will be warm (about 25°C ~ 30°C) and
comfortable, with seasonal winds and monsoon rains cooling the minds.

From nature to humanity, Taiwan offers a wide range of famous tourist
sites.  In the north, Taipei 101 was the tallest building (from 2004
to 2009) in the world, and Yehliu Geopark is famous for its stones in
unique shapes, particularly the Queen's Head rock.  In the south,
Kenting National Park attracts thousands of people with its endless
white-sand beaches.  The Alishan sunrise and the Taroko Gorge are
gorgeous on the east and the west, respectively.  The central part is
dominated by mountain ranges, with Yushan as the tallest peak and Sun
Moon Lake as the largest body of water.  Beyond the main island, each
island of Taiwan shares its own stories and beauty.  To name a few,
you can see blue tears in Matsu and sea turtles around Lambay Island.

Taiwan enjoys its cultural diversity since it is home to many people
with different backgrounds.  That is the way we live here, and that is
also the way how we are going to host the conference!
