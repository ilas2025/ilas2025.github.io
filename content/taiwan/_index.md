Taiwan, located in East Asia, is a captivating destination composed of
more than one hundred islands. The main island, often referred to as
Ilha Formosa, showcases its diverse topography with mountain ranges
covering the eastern two-thirds and sprawling plains in the western
third. The Tropic of Cancer traverses the island, adding to its unique
geography. Taipei, the capital, is situated in the northern part of
the island, while Kaohsiung, the host city of ILAS2025, lies in the
south. If you plan to visit in June, expect warm and comfortable
temperatures ranging from approximately 25°C to 30°C, accompanied by
seasonal winds and refreshing monsoon rains.

From breathtaking natural wonders to captivating cultural landmarks,
Taiwan offers a plethora of renowned tourist sites. In the northern
region, Taipei 101 once held the title of the world's tallest building
(from 2004 to 2009), and Yehliu Geopark fascinates visitors with its
unique rock formations, most notably the famous Queen's Head
rock. Head south to discover the allure of Kenting National Park,
renowned for its endless white-sand beaches. The eastern region boasts
the mesmerizing Alishan sunrise, while the western region is home to
the awe-inspiring Taroko Gorge. Central Taiwan is dominated by
magnificent mountain ranges, with Yushan proudly standing as the
tallest peak, and the serene Sun Moon Lake gracing the landscape as
the largest body of water. Beyond the main island, each of Taiwan's
smaller islands has its own captivating stories and beauty to
explore. From witnessing the enchanting phenomenon of blue tears in
Matsu to encountering sea turtles around Lambay Island, Taiwan's
island treasures are simply mesmerizing.

Taiwan is also celebrated for its culinary delights, ranging from the
world-famous bubble tea to delectable dumplings and a plethora of
local delicacies. Whether you dine at a restaurant, sample street
food, or explore bustling night markets, these gastronomic delights
are easily found throughout the island, tantalizing taste buds and
showcasing the rich flavors of Taiwanese cuisine.

One of Taiwan's greatest strengths lies in its cultural diversity, as
it embraces people from various backgrounds. This inclusivity shapes
the way we live and will be reflected in how we host the
conference. It is this spirit of diversity that creates an enriching
and welcoming environment for all.
