### Kaohsiung

Kaohsiung is a big city in southern Taiwan. It is located on the southwest coast
and is one of Taiwan's largest cities. Kaohsiung has a population of around 2.7 
million people.

The city has a rich history with a former name Takow given by the indigenous 
people.  It was originally a small fishing village many years ago. Over time, it
grew into an important port city. Today, Kaohsiung is known for its busy harbor,
which is one of the largest in the world.

### NSYSU

The conference will be held at National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU) in 
Kaohsiung. The university is beautifully situated, surrounded by Sizihwan Bay 
and Monkey Mountain. This privileged location offers stunning natural views, 
with monkeys often visiting the campus. As long as you keep your food in your 
bag and do not approach them, you'll be charmed by these intelligent creatures.

Founded in 1980, NSYSU currently has about 11,000 students, making it one of the
major universities in Taiwan.

The NSYSU campus and Cijin Island guard the entrance to Kaohsiung Harbor from 
opposite sides. Along both coastlines, you can enjoy stunning sunsets and ocean 
views. Several historical sites are nearby, including the North Gate and South 
Gate forts, the Kaohsiung Lighthouse, and the British Consulate at Takow. A bit 
further from the campus, Pier 2 offers a lovely waterfront walk along Kaohsiung 
Harbor, especially enjoyable with the evening breeze at sunset. The area around 
the Love River provides convenient food options and picturesque river views.

(O4), or light rail stations such as Penglai Pier-2 (C13), Dayi Pier-2 (C12),

### Weather

The Tropic of Cancer passes through Taiwan, placing Kaohsiung in the tropical 
zone. In June, the typical weather in Kaohsiung ranges from about 26 to 32 
degrees Celsius, with most buildings being air-conditioned. It's advisable to 
use sunscreen or wear a light jacket to protect your skin from the sun.

### Currency

The official currency of Taiwan is the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD). Currency 
exchange services are available at the airport. While most hotels, large 
stores, and restaurants accept credit and debit cards, there are still some 
places that only accept cash.

### Tap water

Do not drink the tap water. The school provides drinking fountains on every 
floor, and your hotel is likely to have one as well. Alternatively, you can 
purchase bottled water from convenience stores.

### Safety

Taiwan is considered a very safe destination with low crime rates. Violent 
crime is rare, and petty crime, such as pickpocketing, is uncommon. However, 
it is always wise to exercise general precautions.

Instead, pay extra attention to traffic, as there are many cars and scooters 
around.

### Electricity outlet

Taiwan uses type A and B electrical outlets.  The common voltages are 110V and 
220V.
