### Call for proposals

The ILAS2025 conference welcomes all topics related to linear algebra.  Each 
mini-symposium will feature between 4 to 12 speakers, and 
each talk has 25 minutes, including the questions and discussion. 
If you are interested in 
organizing a mini-symposium at ILAS2025, please use the proposal template
