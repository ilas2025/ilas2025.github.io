### Option 2: Lotus Pond

The [Lotus Pond](https://khh.travel/en/attractions/detail/491) 
is recognized as one of the "Eight Sights of Fongshan." The pond is surrounded 
by ancient-style pavilions, towering statues of deities, and remnants of the 
old city wall. The renowned Dragon and Tiger Pagodas are a highlight, featuring 
two towers with a dragon entrance and a tiger exit---leaving through the 
tiger's mouth symbolizes the act of dispelling bad luck and welcoming good 
fortune.

dressing comfortably due to the outdoor temperature.
